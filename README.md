# Concepts

***1 decentralised adaptive network for task & resource allocation for most of the human population, people trained to work without the network's guidance when technology fails***

<ul><li>Everyone (non tribe) will be chipped.</li>
  <li>Only the owner can take the chip off (hoping we can keep the chip wearable & implanting won't be necessary).</li>
  <li>The tribes willing to continue their tribal ways will be encouraged to do so, other than killing endengared species, beating people for whithc-craft & the like.</li>
  <li>They will be our system restore points & will not b chipped.</li>
  <li>In exchange of help during natural disaster, large disease outbreak the tribes will teach the least bloodlusty of chipped people how to hunt & more of non-tribe population how to move, gather & live in the nearby wilderness.</li>
  <li>Billions of chips will make a network, which allocates resources & tasks to people.
  <ol><li>There will be 2 data blocks in each chip.
    <ol>
    <li><b>Individualdata(idata):</b> Chip records every data & experience of the individual. Experience can be shared. You can send the doctor how feel. <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/greg_gage_how_to_control_someone_else_s_arm_with_your_brain?language=en#t-100356">Tedtalk</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSQNi5sAwuc">youtube link of plausibilty</a><br>The recipient can tone it down or up as needed.</li>
      <li><b>Worlddata(wdata):</b> All of the individual data & environment data required to make decisions. Every one will have a complete copy of world data on their chip. It will update at regular intervals. Individual will not be identifiable in world data.</li></ol></li>
    <li> When users take off the chip it stops recording, unless the user instructs otherwise.</li>
    <li><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fK1wbGB.jpg"> is our idea of data security, needs improvement.</li></ol></li>
  <li><h3>According to need from worlddata & fitness, skills, emotional state from individual data, people will be allocated mandatory tasks</h3><ol>
    <li></li>
    <li></li></ol></li>
  <li> Software update policies have not been figured out yet. But people are free to download,change & experiment with the code of the system on their own devices & suggest changes.</li></ul>
# This thing could take generations to get going, many probably wont live long enough to see their baby in action, this is an idea to unify the people, we only ask you to set things in motion & ensure the plan stays in motion.
##stage 1:##
<ol><li> doing what we can with present tech</li>
  <li> inventing new tech if needed</li>
  <li> testing, tuning, live use by researchers, debuging, hacking, updating</li>
  <li> figuring out policies, rules & regulations</li>
  <li> test with 1000-10000 people</li>
  <li> steps 3 & 4 repeated</li></ol>
