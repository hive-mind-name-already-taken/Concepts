***1 decentralised adaptive network for task & resource allocation for most of the human population, people trained to work without the network's guidance when technology fails***

<ul><li>Everyone (non tribe) will be chipped.</li>
  <li>Only the owner can take the chip off.</li>
  <li>The tribes willing to continue their tribal ways will be encouraged to do so, other than killing endengared species, beating people for whithc-craft & the like.</li>
  <li>They will be our system restore points & will not b chipped.</li>
  <li>In exchange of help during natural disaster, large disease outbreak the tribes will teach the least bloodlusty of chipped people how to hunt & more of non-tribe population how to move, gather & live in the nearby wilderness.</li>
  <li>billions of chips will make a network, which allocates resources & tasks to people.
  <ol><li>There will be 2 data blocks in each chip.
    <ol>
    <li><b>Individualdata</b>: Chip records every data & experience of the individual. Experience can be shared.
