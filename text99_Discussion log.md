 i'm better as 2nd in command, the voice of doubt, always saying what cd go wrong & "i told u so" :P

the hive mind plan we talked abt, we do not completely get rid of leaders & other bad things, people need 2 face enuf 2 b able 2  recognise 'em
i hv worked under a leader, whose leadership i respect, c got stuff done, 5 member team, only her & me were doing actual work
some unchipped humans or aliens may try 2 take over, bt a completely peacful leader-less human kind wd b too easy 2 beat.
tribes who want 2 stick 2 tribal lifestyles will b encouraged 2 do so, they'll b system restore points when technology fails. the people with most reluctance towards bloodshed will b sent 2 learn hunting from the tribes in exchange of help if the tribe is collectively in danger from disease, flood or something. tribes will not b chipped. also 1% of chipped people will learn moving, gathering & living in the wilderness from the tribes
every1 doing mandatory duties gets food, water, toilet, light & other basic needs. those who want more will hv 2 do more.
every1 has 2 do farm & mandatory duties, 1 week with tech, 1 week without

Arkoprovo Ghosh
just returned home
that's great .. but i think war readiness should be done by robots ... & as far as learning warfare is concerned, simulations? .. because why kill harmless animals?
9:22pm
um ... my way wasn't that because that'd again go into becoming a form of monetary system .... my idea was .. everyone would have compulsory duties, ... harmless stuff of course ... like farming, etc... as you said .... and it's mandatory for all ... of course, people may reschedule their duties, but writin a limit so that one doesn't shirk work ... and if someone works more, the only prize one should be getting is a name or greater say, but not extra resources. of course one who doesn't work even if one is not disabled, one isn't allowed the resources
a modified way of how  Wikipedia works that is .

technology WILL fail, i want us trained in a way that after the initial panic subsides, we will gradually transform into a stable nature dependent system while trying 2 regain tech.

11:10pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh
hmm .. but then ... training ok .. needed too .. but not by killing innocent wild animals please

11:12pm
Tuhin Jana
simulations nvr get the real deal
well they can
then a tribe wd hv 2 b chipped
their memory/experience of hunting can b downloaded

11:13pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh
um .. well .. yes .. better idea .. but now we don't have such bci

11:13pm
Tuhin Jana
bci ?

11:14pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh
brain computer interfacing

Tuhin Jana
not now, bt a few gens after our deaths ?
we jst gotta set things in motion

11:14pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh
hmm
maybe
yeah
let's
i guess i hurry too much

11:15pm
Tuhin Jana
if i ever try 2 copy my brain into computers, stop me, i hv this greed for imortality, thus i'm undeserving of it

11:16pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh
hmm ....
but then ... who doesn't especially when young?
and then, just think of it ... today we talk like that because we're caged to this planet ... what about when we are no more?

11:18pm
Tuhin Jana
no my case is different
i want 2 b influencing & "guiding u lil kids"
this craving for power is disqualifying

Arkoprovo Ghosh
um .. i believe you want to teach people .. and it'll soon vanish when you do

11:23pm
Tuhin Jana
nah, i'll put some other immortals in, who mainly observe, their job will b 2 remind people of my example, & wake up copies of coders during extinction level emergencies, the public can suggest improvements, or play with it in their own device. but can not edit the system code dat guides them

Arkoprovo Ghosh
ðŸ˜³

11:25pm
Tuhin Jana
no 1 candidate will b a mother who teaches street children, starts orphanages, volunteers in animal shelters that kinda woman

11:25pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh
wait wait wait
I'm totally lost

11:26pm
Tuhin Jana
* or play with the system code on their own device
lost from where ?

11:27pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh
nah I'll ...

11:30pm
Tuhin Jana
some people will copied into the system, also the programmers will b copied

11:30pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh
what system?

11:30pm
Tuhin Jana
the network of chipped people

11:31pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh
no putting chips inside period
*people

11:31pm
Tuhin Jana
dsnt hv 2 inside, i'd preffer wearable

11:32pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh
um .. wait ...  what's the entire idea? .. i don't get it actually
am totally confused now
i guess i was misunderstanding the model

11:33pm
Tuhin Jana
while i write, u read why i prefer the chip outside the body http://deusex.wikia.com/wiki/Neuropozyne_Withdrawal
http://deusex.wikia.com/wiki/Neuropozyne

11:35pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh
ok
 11:45pm
i still don't get a clue .. but one thing .. yeah .. putting  permanent electrodes into human beings can result them getting controlled .. you know .. like zombies ...
or rather like the matrix

11:57pm
Tuhin Jana
when u wear the chip ur memory will give data 2 the network
so u generally take it off b4 going to toilet, but u were it when u hv problems in toilet or elsewhere, so u can replay the memory in the doctor's mind(i really need this cuz i cnt answer 2 "haatute byatha hob6e na jontrona ?")

11:57pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
good .. but then these chips are disconnected right?
like disconnected from networks

11:58pm
Tuhin Jana
only the owner can take the chip off

11:58pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh
like hard drives
good

24/9/2016, 12:00am
Tuhin Jana
we'll get 2 storage later
there will b individal data & world data
chip is not off when open, it jst dsnt record individual data at that time
by replaying memories i mean he recipient will experience it
can b toned down or up by the recipient

12:02am
Arkoprovo Ghosh
cool
but it's good if data is stored in the chip itself with no interfacing device
rather with no wireless data transfer device built into it
modules can be attached

12:05am
Tuhin Jana
according 2 need from world data & individual health, mood from indiv data, mandatory tasks will b allocated

12:07am
Arkoprovo Ghosh
ah
great idea

12:07am
Tuhin Jana
dude wireless transfer is necessary. its a network of billions. but only 1 network at the top layer
like parallel pies

12:08am
Arkoprovo Ghosh
um .. but say it should be implemented like this ... an evaluation time when people will just connect their biochips to a node and then .. blah blah blah
wireless network and a buggy program and the entire world's data is gone ..

12:11am
Tuhin Jana
the security thing we'll get into later
there will b close alpha among researchers, then beta with a thousand volunteers, then gamma with a million :P
it wont b gone cuz there will b a backup copy of the whole world data in every device, it will of the slow access mega storage kind

12:11am
Arkoprovo Ghosh
um .. no .. by gone i meant breach of privacy

12:15am
Tuhin Jana
i also thought of using people's brains' processing power when they sleep, but nt happening cuz no chips inside
parts of individual data go into world data like what u like 2 do, what u r good at, capable of a certain task or not
the indiv will not b identifyable though
to any1 but the network

12:17am
Arkoprovo Ghosh
um .. u mean like hashing right?

12:17am
Tuhin Jana
now abt prtecting the rest of the indiv data
*using paint*

12:18am
Arkoprovo Ghosh
?

Tuhin Jana
i'm drawing, ur pc fixed ?

12:20am
Arkoprovo Ghosh
using laptop

12:23am

12:24am
Arkoprovo Ghosh
yes .. but individuals can be tapped .. just like they can be caught on tape .. you know
a person doing a mitm from near the other guy

12:25am
Tuhin Jana
mitm ?

12:26am
Arkoprovo Ghosh
man in the middle

12:27am
Tuhin Jana
they'll hv 2 get a room :P
the need for privacy & secrecy will b lower
there wont b any govt. or corporation

12:28am
Arkoprovo Ghosh
i know that
i meant .. say terrorist organizations or gangs

12:31am
Tuhin Jana
without the existence of money dat wont b much of a prob either

12:32am
Arkoprovo Ghosh
um .. no like .. there will be say team leaders right, for various tasks

12:33am
Tuhin Jana
aaand ?

12:35am
Arkoprovo Ghosh
so if say they're onto something, like say a matter antimatter reactor ... a gang can use the chip to sabotage the project and create their own version and create a monetary system by denying people that

12:35am
Tuhin Jana
i gotta go
will talk tomorrow

12:36am
Arkoprovo Ghosh
sleepy?
actually ... one must always be prepared for an attack on the system
like .. BSD licence .. it just gave stuff away for free ... Jobs took it and the rest is history .. 
on the other hand, GNU GPL and Creative Commons licenses .. they have clauses to protect their system .. open patenting too
that's my point
Saturday

1:51pm
Tuhin Jana
the network will decide & control who gets what, delivered by robots/ conveyer

2:28pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh
er?

2:46pm
Tuhin Jana
avoiding "so if say they're onto something, like say a matter antimatter reactor ... a gang can use the chip to sabotage the project and create their own version and create a monetary system by denying people that"

3:01pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh
hmm ... but hey .. i feel i got it .. wifi chips are a good idea .. but the chips can be hacked by users .. so wifi on & off whenever needed

3:04pm
Tuhin Jana
what of the drawing i made man
the share block cant send any request to indiv data block<br/><img src="https://fbcdn-photos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t34.0-0/p280x280/14483914_1185260828201907_1734751889_n.jpg?oh=c330e905f56c22cd9b83f44cc8550020&oe=57EEF82E&__gda__=1475198456_def2d5d576b6be689f6c6fd8bfed03fb"><br/>
