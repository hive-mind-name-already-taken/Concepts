i'm better as 2nd in command, the voice of doubt, always saying what cd go wrong & "i told u so" :P

6:51pm 
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
 :p

7:06pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
the hive mind plan we talked abt, we do not completely get rid of leaders & other bad things, people need 2 face enuf 2 b able 2  recognise 'em<br/>
i hv worked under a leader, whose leadership i respect, c got stuff done, 5 member team, only her & me were doing actual work<br/>
some unchipped humans or aliens may try 2 take over, bt a completely peacful leader-less human kind wd b too easy 2 beat.<br/>
tribes who want 2 stick 2 tribal lifestyles will b encouraged 2 do so, they'll b system restore points when technology fails. the people with most reluctance towards bloodshed will b sent 2 learn hunting from the tribes in exchange of help if the tribe is collectively in danger from disease, flood or something. tribes will not b chipped. also 1% of chipped people will learn moving, gathering & living in the wilderness from the tribes<br/>
every1 doing mandatory duties gets food, water, toilet, light & other basic needs. those who want more will hv 2 do more.<br/>
every1 has 2 do farm & mandatory duties, 1 week with tech, 1 week without<br/>

9:09pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
just returned home<br/>
that's great .. but i think war readiness should be done by robots ... & as far as learning warfare is concerned, simulations? .. because why kill harmless animals?<br/>
9:22pm
um ... my way wasn't that because that'd again go into becoming a form of monetary system .... my idea was .. everyone would have compulsory duties, ... harmless stuff of course ... like farming, etc... as you said .... and it's mandatory for all ... of course, people may reschedule their duties, but writin a limit so that one doesn't shirk work ... and if someone works more, the only prize one should be getting is a name or greater say, but not extra resources. of course one who doesn't work even if one is not disabled, one isn't allowed the resources<br/>
a modified way of how  Wikipedia works that is .

11:09pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
technology WILL fail, i want us trained in a way that after the initial panic subsides, we will gradually transform into a stable nature dependent system while trying 2 regain tech.

11:10pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
hmm .. but then ... training ok .. needed too .. but not by killing innocent wild animals please

11:12pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
simulations nvr get the real deal<br/>
well they can<br/>
then a tribe wd hv 2 b chipped<br/>
their memory/experience of hunting can b downloaded<br/>

11:13pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um .. well .. yes .. better idea .. but now we don't have such bci

11:13pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
bci ?

11:14pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
brain computer interfacing

Tuhin Jana
not now, bt a few gens after our deaths ?<br/>
we jst gotta set things in motion

11:14pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
hmm<br/>
maybe<br/>
yeah<br/>
let's<br/>
i guess i hurry too much

11:15pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
if i ever try 2 copy my brain into computers, stop me, i hv this greed for imortality, thus i'm undeserving of it

11:16pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
hmm ....<br/>
but then ... who doesn't especially when young?<br/>
and then, just think of it ... today we talk like that because we're caged to this planet ... what about when we are no more?

11:18pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
no my case is different<br/>
i want 2 b influencing & "guiding u lil kids"<br/>
this craving for power is disqualifying

Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um .. i believe you want to teach people .. and it'll soon vanish when you do

11:23pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
nah, i'll put some other immortals in, who mainly observe, their job will b 2 remind people of my example, & wake up copies of coders during extinction level emergencies, the public can suggest improvements, or play with it in their own device. but can not edit the system code dat guides them

Arkoprovo Ghosh
ðŸ˜³

11:25pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
no. 1 candidate will b a mother who teaches street children, starts orphanages, volunteers in animal shelters that kinda woman

11:25pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
wait wait wait<br/>
I'm totally lost

11:26pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
* or play with the system code on their own device<br/>
lost from where ?

11:27pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
nah I'll ...<br/>

11:30pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
some people will copied into the system, also the programmers will b copied

11:30pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
what system?

11:30pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
the network of chipped people

11:31pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
no putting chips inside period<br/>
*people

11:31pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
dsnt hv 2 inside, i'd preffer wearable

11:32pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um .. wait ...  what's the entire idea? .. i don't get it actually<br/>
am totally confused now<br/>
i guess i was misunderstanding the model

11:33pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
while i write, u read why i prefer the chip outside the body http://deusex.wikia.com/wiki/Neuropozyne_Withdrawal
http://deusex.wikia.com/wiki/Neuropozyne

11:35pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
ok<br/>
11:45pm<br/>
i still don't get a clue .. but one thing .. yeah .. putting  permanent electrodes into human beings can result them getting controlled .. you know .. like zombies ...<br/>
or rather like the matrix

11:57pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
when u wear the chip ur memory will give data 2 the network<br/>
so u generally take it off b4 going to toilet, but u were it when u hv problems in toilet or elsewhere, so u can replay the memory in the doctor's mind(i really need this cuz i cnt answer 2 "haatute byatha hob6e na jontrona ?")<br/>

11:57pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚<br/>
good .. but then these chips are disconnected right?<br/>
like disconnected from networks

11:58pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
only the owner can take the chip off

11:58pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
like hard drives<br/>
good

Saturday,24/9/2016, 12:00am
Tuhin Jana<br/>
we'll get 2 storage later<br/>
there will b individal data & world data<br/>
chip is not off when open, it jst dsnt record individual data at that time<br/>
by replaying memories i mean he recipient will experience it<br/>
can b toned down or up by the recipient

12:02am
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
cool<br/>
but it's good if data is stored in the chip itself with no interfacing device<br/>
rather with no wireless data transfer device built into it<br/>
modules can be attached

12:05am
Tuhin Jana<br/>
according 2 need from world data & individual health, mood from indiv data, mandatory tasks will b allocated

12:07am
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
ah<br/>
great idea

12:07am
Tuhin Jana<br/>
dude wireless transfer is necessary. its a network of billions. but only 1 network at the top layer<br/>
like parallel pies

12:08am
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um .. but say it should be implemented like this ... an evaluation time when people will just connect their biochips to a node and then .. blah blah blah<br/>
wireless network and a buggy program and the entire world's data is gone ..

12:11am
Tuhin Jana<br/>
the security thing we'll get into later<br/>
there will b close alpha among researchers, then beta with a thousand volunteers, then gamma with a million :P<br/>
it wont b gone cuz there will b a backup copy of the whole world data in every device, it will of the slow access mega storage kind

12:11am
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um .. no .. by gone i meant breach of privacy

12:15am
Tuhin Jana<br/>
i also thought of using people's brains' processing power when they sleep, but nt happening cuz no chips inside<br/>
parts of individual data go into world data like what u like 2 do, what u r good at, capable of a certain task or not<br/>
the indiv will not b identifyable though<br/>
to any1 but the network

12:17am
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um .. u mean like hashing right?

12:17am
Tuhin Jana<br/>
now abt prtecting the rest of the indiv data<br/>
*using paint*

12:18am
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
?

Tuhin Jana<br/>
i'm drawing, ur pc fixed ?

12:20am
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
using laptop

12:23am
Tuhin Jana<br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EYOpUZs.jpg"/><br/>

12:24am
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
yes .. but individuals can be tapped .. just like they can be caught on tape .. you know<br/>
a person doing a mitm from near the other guy

12:25am
Tuhin Jana<br/>
mitm ?

12:26am
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
man in the middle

12:27am
Tuhin Jana<br/>
they'll hv 2 get a room :P<br/>
the need for privacy & secrecy will b lower<br/>
there wont b any govt. or corporation

12:28am
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
i know that<br/>
i meant .. say terrorist organizations or gangs

12:31am
Tuhin Jana<br/>
without the existence of money dat wont b much of a prob either

12:32am
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um .. no like .. there will be say team leaders right, for various tasks

12:33am
Tuhin Jana<br/>
aaand ?

12:35am
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
so if say they're onto something, like say a matter antimatter reactor ... a gang can use the chip to sabotage the project and create their own version and create a monetary system by denying people that<br/>

12:35am
Tuhin Jana<br/>
i gotta go<br/>
will talk tomorrow

12:36am
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
sleepy?<br/>
actually ... one must always be prepared for an attack on the system<br/>
like .. BSD licence .. it just gave stuff away for free ... Jobs took it and the rest is history .. <br/>
on the other hand, GNU GPL and Creative Commons licenses .. they have clauses to protect their system .. open patenting too<br/>
that's my point


1:51pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
the network will decide & control who gets what, delivered by robots/ conveyer

2:28pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
er?

2:46pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
avoiding "so if say they're onto something, like say a matter antimatter reactor ... a gang can use the chip to sabotage the project and create their own version and create a monetary system by denying people that"

3:01pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
hmm ... but hey .. i feel i got it .. wifi chips are a good idea .. but the chips can be hacked by users .. so wifi on & off whenever needed

3:04pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
what of the drawing i made man<br/>
the share block cant send any request to indiv data block<br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EYOpUZs.jpg"><br/>

3:10pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
hmm .. what i meant was like passwords going haywire .. but then, isn't that why encryption exists?

3:53pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
u r a non gamer, u hvnt got the whole idea, but what we discussed r the percevable/plausible limits of tech<br/>
parts of the rest r in the vdos<br/>
in 2186 AD<br/>
1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77PNj0e_Iyk<br/>
2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_JvTacJpcQ<br/>
& a few hundred thousands of yrs later when the tech failed<br/>
3) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqDnKfXSBAc<br/>
long explanatory webpage that i'm making will come later<br/>

3:54pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>

4:19pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
some hackers became powerful, controlling nano-machines 2 get shit done. then there was division, 'us' & 'them' & extinction level wars. few of the powerful tried 2 maintain peace, fenharel/dread wolf/god of rebellion/god of trickery/solas was the most devious among them. he made access 2 the network very limited & blocked out all the non-peaceful powerful people. it stopped the war but everything else sucked. <br/>
related dialog: <br/>
Inquisitor: How did they come to be remembered as gods? <br/>
Solas: Slowly. It started with a war. War breeds fear. Fear breeds a desire for simplicity. Good and evil. Right and wrong. Chains of command. After the war ended, generals became respected elders, then kings, then finally gods

4:21pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
you know ... let's just sit and start from the start someday .... #extremelyConfused

4:21pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
jst watch the vdos in series

4:21pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
ok wait<br/>
am deep into something right now .. you'll understand when i post

4:23pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
ok, 35 mins total for the vdos, so watch wen u hv time<br/>

4:23pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
ok ...

8:25pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
i got ur post vaguely, making a github account, quite clueless<br/>
dnt tell me stuff unless i ask, i better try 2 figure it out myself<br/>

8:25pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
hmm ... ok<br/>
actually ... am confused too

8:26pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
i'm a bit backdated & slow :P

8:26pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
no ... too far ahead

9:05pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
how to find u in github ?

9:06pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
Arkoprovo1996

9:08pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
tuhinrocks77

9:08pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
ok

9:22pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
found kong

9:22pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
no

9:23pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
dat was a statement not question<br/>
this guy sunipkmukherjee

9:23pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
oh<br/>
ok

9:29pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
making organisation 2 see how that works, will try 2 add u

9:31pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
sure

9:39pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
accept invite man

9:42pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
where?

9:42pm<br/>
Tuhin Jana
in github, i sent invite 2 u 2 join hive-mind-name-already-taken

9:48pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
very nice name!!! -_-<br/>

Sunday,9/25, 2:49pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
seen the videos ?

2:52pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
yesterday only

2:52pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
in the order i gave ?

2:52pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
yes

2:53pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
made any sense ?

2:53pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
none<br/>
dragon age did<br/>
mass effect no

2:55pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
did u get the 'what' part of mass effect ? <br/>
not the 'why' & 'who'

2:55pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
yes ... war between man and machine .... answer ... merge both

2:58pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
& 'the' network was born<br/>
which fucked up a few tens of thousand yrs b4 dragon age, after the events of elder scrolls game series. then politics changed history

2:59pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
ok ... so?

3:01pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
Notorious for the extent of their special nano-augmentation, the Omar are not fully individuals, rather, each Omar is crosslinked into one massive consciousness, achieved through the replacement of their frontal lobes with a wireless cortical interface. Thus, if something happens to an Omar, then all Omar will know about it and react accordingly http://deusex.wikia.com/wiki/Omar

3:02pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
yes ... collective intelligence<br/>
but it does have limitations .. it removes individuality if compulsory<br/>
like it's presented

3:10pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
dat we'll get 2 ater the initial chip idea is successful, i wanted 2 use sleeping people's brains processing power for world data<br/>
& the individuality will b preserved cuz u'll only get notifications of if some1 nearby neeeds help

3:12pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
oh ... that's not collective Intel .. that's telepathy<br/>
but wrt the first idea .. do u know what consciousness is?

3:15pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
adaptive response 2 external/internal stimuli & will of self preservation ? <br/>
jst a bunch of electrical signals we need 2 copy :P

3:18pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um .. u know cellular automata right? <br/>
actually none knows .. but a strong belief is that the sharing of info between neurons in the brain in a graph create consciousness ..in steps ...like if i see a path to the right, the a neuron bound by it's choices, decides that it should poke the other neuron .. and do the chain goes<br/>
so the neurons aren't state l aware .. but the collective is<br/>
now if you're using people's brain power like you said, since the brain is an organic, it can lead to multiple personalities inside a person<br/>
so like once the collective controls a muscle, nothing can stop it from sending the original personality to the background forever<br/>
got it? <br/>
like controlled dissociative identity disorder

3:27pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
ok

3:27pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
what?

3:29pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
i understood what u meant, now processing its links 2 how processors work<br/>
then also those chapters of neural network of last semester

3:31pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um ... i don't know .. chapters of neutral network last semester

3:32pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
amader last sem e 6ilo

3:33pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
yes ... so what did they say?

3:37pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
not much, a virtual network of 'neurons' wd work as they r trained 2<br/>
there r diff types of training<br/>
1 is where u jst tell 'em ifo/p is wrong or not repetitively, the network adjusts the gains of its axons & dendrons accordingly<br/>
another was user sets the gains & checks if they r correct<br/>
another was the network checks the o/p with a reference & corrects it self<br/>
the neurons dnt do much after they r trained, they only remain the connecting nodes among axons & dendrons

3:45pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
yes<br/>
that's the cellular automata part ... i don't know much ... but that's the way they work .. I'm also talking about how they train themselves<br/>
that hypothesis<br/>
the last one yes<br/>
that's how we learn right?

3:48pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
with rat brains flying fighter planes in simulators, its sugar rewards :P

3:48pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
true that

3:56pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
we train till we die, thinking how

3:56pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
yes

3:56pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
sorroundings

3:57pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
hmm

3:59pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
we jst want them feel good internal hormone rewards, our interaction with surroundings(including our own body) guides it<br/>
thinking 'how'

4:02pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
hmm .. i always think that it's due to evolution - the rewards morphed to what they are due to evolutionary chaos

4:03pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
do we intend 2 copy ?

4:03pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um .. like?

4:05pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
may b we do, the world data wd fucntion like that, but the training nvr stops

4:06pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
come again ...

4:08pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
the network wd get rewards for doing good, so the action is repeated for similar i/p<br/>
doing good : max people healthy, fit & functioning, environment doing well, enuf food storage/production, most people getting 2 do "what u like tasks" more often

4:11pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um ... I'm not talking about that<br/>
it's just that using people's brain .. aka write access can create a multiple personality disorder<br/>
because brains can't be disconnected from muscles<br/>
except a workaround

4:15pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
how abt blocking write access 2 memory ? <br/>
nah, our aint built like modules

4:16pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um .. neurons work differently .. <br/>
yeah<br/>
all stuff together<br/>
v dangerous

4:17pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
ok, not working on semi OMAR plans yet

4:17pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
hmm<br/>
but the rest of it is a great idea ...telepathy et al ..global memories too

4:18pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
well with that issue set aside, how does the network update itself for better results after programmers r dead ?

4:19pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um .. what do u mean programers are dead?

4:20pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
& how 2 set limits 2 updating, so we dnt hv solas taking town the system dragon age style 2 save people

4:20pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
actually i can't totaly get what the whole concept/plan is ... that's why i told you to write it up in that concepts file<br/>
lemme read the storylines of dragon age & mass effect .. i guess then i can understand

4:21pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
no need, i'm making the page, pujor por pabi<br/>
u hv stuff 2 do, my page will save time<br/>
where is the concepts file ?

4:22pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um .. page? <br/>
github

4:23pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
sobai dekhte pabe to

4:23pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
whole world

4:24pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
a big somewhat interactive timeline page spanning 5 fiction serieses<br/>
well if u say so

4:25pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
bujhlaam na thik

4:26pm
Tuhin Jana
the explanatory page, pujor por pabi

4:27pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
ok

5:43pm

actually ... i didn't understand one thing .. like your final goal

Tuhin Jana<br/>
the universe is dying, how 2 avoid/bypass that

Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
universe? <br/>
you mean big chill?

5:44pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
yup

5:44pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um ..... actually it's not<br/>
dark energy

5:45pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
whatever, stuff is gonna expand & matter will break apart

5:46pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
not so sure about that<br/>
need to learn n more

5:52pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
that wd b very comforting if u cd convince me that stuff will not expand enuf that no molucles cd interact & life will not b gone. untill then, i'll try 2 unify us. when unified, all of us will b focused on these problems<br/>
1) sun is dying, we gotta make home somewhere else. how do we preserve every other species if we can<br/>
2) universe is dying, how do u avoid. bypass that

5:53pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
um .. i too want unification<br/>
universe is dying ... no idea ... noob there because you can't control the universe .. we know too little and i even less<br/>
sun .... go to another star system or live in a giant spaceship<br/>
i mean .. that's how i see the future .. people in a spaceship<br/>
and unless people are united, you'll be having a departure like in the movie 2012

5:56pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
i want our species, to live forever, without politics erasing history ever

5:56pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
me too<br/>
and i guess i hit the nail<br/>
left part and right part both work differently<br/>
now a human would be needing both all the time<br/>
now during sleep, if somehow i can process info without training the neurons in my clients brain, then the hive mind would work<br/>
otherwise, it'd all average out into a clone of one being throughout the world<br/>
or maybe i just got you to square one again<br/>
actually ... the hive mind concept is awesome .... but it's just that the hive might also wipe the individual or convert him completely .... the  problem isn't philosophical<br/>
it's technological<br/>
dissociative identity disorder is a real thing .... I'm just worried about that ... i guess I'm not getting it totally either<br/>
i need to learn more

6:08pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
dnt call. write, let me finish the concept file 1st

6:09pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
ok

Tuhin Jana<br/>
individuality has 2 b protected<br/>
if we r 2 remain the most savage & ingenious species

6:10pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
and I'm not against the idea ... I'm for it .. i just used to think in a less tech manner for today ... using existing technology ... just that direct interfacing with the brain needs more thinking<br/>
um ... how is savage related to individuality? <br/>
but you know .... i think we should experiment ... because thinking blankly won't help

6:17pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
hmm<br/>
k<br/>
:P

6:17pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
hmm<br/>
you saw inception right?

6:18pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
yup

6:19pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
that's the thing I'm fearing ... because while sleeping, we're not fully conscious

6:20pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
& while sleeping some dude figured out how benzine looks

6:20pm<br/>
Arkoprovo Ghosh
yes

Tuhin Jana<br/>
he dreamt of a snake eating itself

Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
i know the story of kekule

6:27pm
Arkoprovo Ghosh<br/>
the idea is fascinating ... but i also wonder if the brain can take it ..... and what I'm against is that when you're doing stuff with part of the brain, the individual cannot decide

6:28pm
Tuhin Jana<br/>
in the dragon age series only those having the reaper nanomachines in their bodies can access the fade (network) beyond the vail (firewal by solas) only when sleeping & dreaming. some dreamt themselves 2 death. <br/>
i can see a few second long clippings of future situations i'll b in, camera location is my eyes. but i only remember them when facing the situation. used it a few times not 2 get caught. it makes me question the idea of time itself. <br/>
ok ok we r not going 2 try using the brains processing power at large<br/>
