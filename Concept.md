# Concepts

***A decentralised adaptive network for task & resource allocation for the human population***

Everyone will be able to obtain a n-chip,for one-self. The n-chips will be be a user removable, BCI conncecting an individual's brain to a high-speed memory device containing thoughts & ideas to be processed. Billions of n-chips will form a global network, which shares individual thoughts to create a collective - the hive.

There will be *TWO* data blocks in each chip, they being:

1. **Individual Data (idata)**: Chips record every datum & experience of the individual and depending on user's choices, sends data to the global network. The individual data can't be deleted without the individual giving write access to it. Of course, it can be read. Thus, it'll enable thoughts & experiences to be shared - directly.
    Experience can be shared individually, like one can send the doctor how one feels. This [TED-Talk]("https://www.ted.com/talks/greg_gage_how_to_control_someone_else_s_arm_with_your_brain?language=en) gives a sketchy idea of how. The recipient can tone it down or up as needed.

	Or it may be shared globally through world data, described below.
		
2. **World Data (wdata)**: The *idata* data from the network of individuals gets downloaded to the part known as world data or maybe, has links to decentralized servers holding it. An individual has read & write access to his copy of world data, which can be merged into the original, like pull requests in GitHub. Thus, if worn during sleep, or even at other periods, it can be used to process the information via the individual's brains, using their biases, their conditioning, their emotions, their logic. Since it'd be updated in very short periods, conflicts in global thoughts can be resolved faster, enabling almost everyone to agree upon choices instead of blankly having to 'follow the rules'. It'd thus solve the need for a hierarchial structure of rulers & subjects.
	
Notes:-

   * ![This]("http://i.imgur.com/fK1wbGB.jpg") is our idea of data security, needs improvement.
   * According to need from worlddata & fitness, skills, emotional state from individual data, people will be allocated mandatory tasks
   * It involves farming, cleaning sewers, maintaining facilities.
   * Everyone is taught how to farm, like one is taught to buy stuff from the market today.
   * The mandatory tasks are required to be done by all - rescheduling is allowed, but only a limited no. of times, so that no one can shirk their duties. Thus, everyone does what they're required to do. Tasks will be assigned based on interests & capabilities of people, recognized through the n-chips.
   * Software updates OTA or by flashing. People are free to download, change & experiment with the code of the system on their own devices & suggest changes, as in any FOSSS model.
	 * The individual chips can be hacked by the users, so that they control the chips and not the other way around.

***This thing could take generations to get going, many probably wont live long enough to see their baby in action, this is an idea to unify the people, efficiently & without violence. We only ask you to set things in motion & ensure the plan stays in motion.***

###### Stage 1:

- R&D Phase
- Development of the BCI & software
- Improving the security & removing any glitches - technological or conceptual.
- Testing alpha & beta versions post simulations in small user groups
- Obtaining as similar as possible results using current technology such as social media (one which will be programed here)

###### Stage 2:

- Public distribution of the n-chips & setting the hive in motion
